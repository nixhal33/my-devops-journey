# 🚀 Mini Project – Day 13

This is my **first fully automated project** using **Vagrant + Shell Provisioning**, where I hosted:

- A static website (Phase 1)
- A full WordPress setup (Phase 2)

Everything is managed using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** — no manual SSH, just `vagrant up` and it's live.

## 🔧 What's Inside

- `website/` → Eurolinux VM that auto-hosts a café-themed static website.
- `wordpress/` → Ubuntu VM that installs and configures full WordPress stack (LAMP).

## 📝 Notes

All the logic, learning, errors (mostly typos 😅), and review are documented in:  
➡️ `myreview-day13.md`

## 📌 Highlights

- Used shell scripts in provisioning block inside `Vagrantfile`
- Learned a lot through debugging silly typos
- Realized the power of **automation** and **IaC**

✅ It works — it’s clean — and it’s automated.
