# 🗓️ Day 1 – Basic Linux Commands

## 🧰 Commands Practiced:
📁 `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`  
🛠️ `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`  
🧠 `whoami`, `uptime`, `hostname`, `cat`, `file`

## ✍️ My Review:
✅ Navigation commands = super easy & friendly  
😎 File handling = smooth & kinda fun  
🔗 Symlinks = new but I liked the logic  
🧩 System files & `/proc` = confusing at times  
⚠️ Text processing needs more practice  
🎯 Overall: Felt productive! One command at a time 💻

Conclusion: 
I felt like eating a butter and a rice while using the navigation commands. They are the easiest one. Symlinks are bit tricky as there are two types of it like hard/soft link but i am total control of it.Text processing are the trickiest one and need more practice. I am going more deep on text processing commands for the next day. For then thank you for reading this. See you on next day.!!
