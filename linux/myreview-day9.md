🚀 Linux & DevOps Journey – Day 9: Starting a New Chapter – Vagrant & Linux Servers

Although today is Saturday and I intended to take a break, I still decided to show up — just not too harshly. I took it light and focused on conceptual understanding rather than jumping straight into hands-on work.

From today, I'm starting a new section, since I wrapped up my Linux fundamentals yesterday. This new journey will dive into virtualization and provisioning using Vagrant!
🆕 New Section: Vagrant & Linux Servers
📌 Today's Focus: Vagrant IP, RAM & CPU – Conceptual Recap

So far, I’ve been using Vagrant to automate virtual machine creation (Ubuntu, CentOS) in the background. Everything I’ve done so far was made much easier thanks to Vagrant.

Today, I didn’t do practicals — just made myself comfortable with what’s coming ahead, and set the intention for this new chapter.
📚 Topics I Plan to Learn in This Section:

    Intro to Vagrant (quick recap of purpose & usage)

    Creating VMs Automatically with Vagrantfile

    Vagrant Commands – more advanced this time

    Vagrant Networking – getting into port forwarding & private networks

    Provisioning – in my words: preconfigured tools/software setup when VMs spin up

    RAM, CPU, Disk Customization – fine-tuning resources

    Multi-VM Setup – running multiple VMs from a single Vagrantfile

    Documentation – exploring how to properly document and maintain Vagrant configs

❤️ Personal Reflection

📆 I’ve decided to take Saturdays as my rest day moving forward. It helps recharge my energy and maintain a consistent pace without burnout.

💡 Still, I’m glad I showed up today — no pressure, just clarity. Tomorrow, I’ll get back into the practical part with a refreshed mindset.

Thanks for reading — stay tuned for tomorrow as I set up my first multi-VM Vagrant environment! Let’s keep growing, one day at a time. 🙌

If you are working on the same thing and need help or have problem with my repo or error in my works then please feel free to connect with me. I take all positive and negative feedbacks.
