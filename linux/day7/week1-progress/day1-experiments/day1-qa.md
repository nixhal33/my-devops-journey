1.🔍 What command would you use to find out which shell you're currently using?
= echo $0


2.📁 Navigate to /etc, then print the relative path back to your home directory.
= To enter : cd /etc/ and back to my own dir: cd /home/vagrant/my-devops-journey/linux


3.🏷️  Display a long listing (ls -l) of the /bin directory, but only show entries that start with the letter g.
= ls -l /bin/g* ----> (i fumbled here a little hoping grep would be the best command but it wa
s just a simple command.)


4.🔂 Using a single command, create a folder mydir, cd into it, and create a file hello.txt inside it.
= mkdir mydir/ && cd mydir/ && touch hello.txt


5.📂 Create a directory tree like linux/commands/basic and use a single command to go directly into basic.
= mkdir -p linux/commands/basic && cd linux/commands/basic	
	linux
	└── commands
    		└── basic
