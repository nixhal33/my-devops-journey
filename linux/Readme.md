These files like Day1-basic-commands.md file are types of files where I have stored the commands that I practiced through my entire journey or that typical day I have practiced commands on this day. Similarly, myreview-day1.md etc file justlike it's name contains my entire review about the commands i practiced, how i practiced, where i practicied, the problem i faced and how i solved it are stored. So, if you read my any of these file and found any error then I will be extremely grateful to you. Thank you for taking out your time for me. Thank you !!!
