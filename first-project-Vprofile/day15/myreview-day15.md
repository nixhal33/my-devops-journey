# 🗓️ Day 15 Review: vProfile Project Setup (Manual - Local Environment)

## 📌 Today's Mission

The goal was to manually set up a **multi-tier Java web application (vProfile)** on local VMs using **Vagrant**. This setup is the **foundation** for advanced DevOps projects like Dockerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and CI/CD pipeline design.

Today’s emphasis was on **understanding the infrastructure manually**, not just automating it. Learning the pain points is key before automating the solutions.

## 🔧 Tools & Environment

- 🖥️ **VirtualBox** – Hypervisor for running the VMs  
- 📦 **Vagrant** – Provisioning and VM orchestration  
- 🔧 **Git Bash** – Command execution environment  
- 📝 **VS Code** – For editing and debugging Vagrantfile and scripts  
- 🌐 **vagrant-hostmanager plugin** – For mapping VM hostnames to IPs easily

## 📂 Project Overview

### 🎯 Purpose

- **Baseline Setup** – Build the vProfile stack from scratch  
- **Hands-On Lab** – Get comfortable configuring services manually  
- **Better Automation Later** – Know the “why” before automating the “how”

## 🧱 Stack Components

The application is built around a **5-tier architecture**:

| Component   | Purpose                                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Nginx**   | Load balancer & reverse proxy             |
| **Tomcat**  | Java web server hosting the application   |
| **MySQL**   | Database storing user credentials         |
| **Memcached** | Caching frequent DB queries             |
| **RabbitMQ** | Asynchronous messaging queue             |
